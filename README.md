After the admin logs into the account he is directed to the home page. In the home page there is a link to a folder called view passengers. If he clicks that link he can view the list of passengers who have booked the ticket. For every user there is an option to destroy the user. Once this option is clicked the user data is destroyed.

In the home page there is a link called view reviews which takes us to the reviews page. In this page we can see the reviews that are displayed along with the user name, train number, rating, feedback and show this review option. If passengers click the show this review option they can go to the edit this review page where they can edit the reviews given.

After the passenger creates an account he can logs into the account and he is directed to the home page. In the home page there is an option called book a ticket where he can select the departure station and arrival station. After clicking this option he can see a list of trains that are present. Beside that there is an option to book a ticket. Once he clicks the option the passenger gets a message “Ticket was successfully created” and a confirmation number is generated.
